Suvera, a real-time digital healthcare ecosystem designed to streamline emergency response by connecting patients and hospitals instantly. The system provides secure user authentication, symptom-based emergency assistance, optimized osm routing algorithm routing, nearby hospital discovery, first-aid guidance, and an SOS alert feature. Hospitals access an admin panel to facilities, emergency requests, manage beds, doctor availability, with real-time updates. By integrating smart navigation, verified hospital resources, and rapid communication channels. Suvera enables a transparent, efficient, and life-saving emergency care experience for both users and hospitals.

1. Frontend Technology/Framework
•	Framework: React.js (JavaScript/ES6+)
•	Routing & State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) with custom state-based navigation.
•	Mapping Engine: Leaflet.js (integrated via leaflet npm package) for interactive maps.
•	Styling: Custom CSS (Responsive Grid layouts, Glassmorphism, CSS Animations).
•	HTTP Client: Axios (for communicating with the .NET Backend and Python AI Service).
•	Terminal : npm start
                      
2. Backend Technology/Framework
Primary Backend (Business Logic & Data):
•	Framework: ASP.NET Core Web API (C# .NET  version 8).
•	ORM (Object-Relational Mapper): Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for database interactions.
•	Architecture: Repository Pattern (Controllers → Services → Repositories → Database).
•	Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) & Custom Hashing.
                                   
Secondary Backend (AI & NLP Microservice):
•	Language: Python 3.x.
•	Framework: FastAPI (Uvicorn server).
•	Key Libraries:
o	openai-whisper (Voice-to-Text/Speech Recognition).
o	nltk (Natural Language Processing & Keyword Extraction).
o	deep-translator (Language Translation).
o	scikit-learn / difflib (Sequence matching).
o	(run the below cmds in a separate terminal at the frontend folder)
       New Terminal (frontend project folder)
o	 pip install --upgrade numba llvmlite 
o	uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000 
                                   
3. Database Used
•	Database System: Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL).
•	Management Tool: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
•	Core Tables: Patients, Hospitals, Doctors, Facilities, EmergencyRequests.
                                   
4. Additional Tools/Services
•	Routing API: OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) - Used for calculating distance and drawing route paths on the map between the user and hospital.
•	LLM Integration: Groq API (Llama-3 models) - Used for the "Medical Assistant" Chatbot features.
•	Audio Processing: FFmpeg (System-level dependency required for OpenAI Whisper).
•	API Documentation: Swagger UI (used for testing the .NET API endpoints).
•	Create separate env file in the vs code for the chatbot integration and add the below content (frontend folder)
